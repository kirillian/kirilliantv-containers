## How to Improve the Multiplayer Experience

The [Satisfactory Wiki](https://satisfactory.fandom.com/wiki/Multiplayer#Engine.ini) recommends a few config tweaks to really get the best out of multiplayer. These changes are already applied to the server, but they need to be applied to your local config too:

-   Press `WIN + R`
-   Enter `%localappdata%/FactoryGame/Saved/Config/WindowsNoEditor`
-   Copy the config data from the wiki into the respective files
-   Right-click each of the 3 config files (Engine.ini, Game.ini, Scalability.ini)
-   Go to Properties > tick Read-only under the attributes
